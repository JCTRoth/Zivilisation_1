== Game Concepts

=== Terminology

* *Round*: A round is completed when all active (alive) players have finished their turns. The game year advances at the end of each round.
* *Turn*: Each player has one turn per round if they are active (not eliminated). Each turn has phases: START → UNIT_MOVEMENT → CITY_PRODUCTION → RESEARCH → END.
* *Move*: Each unit has available moves (`movesRemaining`) that can be used during their owner's turn. Units cannot exceed their movement limit per turn.

=== Time Progression

The game models historical progression starting at 4000 BC and advances the year at the end of each round using era-dependent increments:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Era |Years per Round

|Before 1000 AD
|+20 years

|1000–1499 AD
|+10 years

|1500–1749 AD
|+5 years

|1750–1849 AD
|+2 years

|1850+ AD
|+1 year
|===

NOTE: The game skips year 0 (historically there is no year 0). The transition goes from 1 BC directly to 1 AD.

The year is displayed in the UI with the appropriate BC/AD suffix (e.g., "Turn 1|4000 BC").
